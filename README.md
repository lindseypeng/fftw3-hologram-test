# fftw3-hologram-test
Taking in a single picture to run a convolution reconstruction on it-used cv2 and fftw3
Main file to run the fourier transforms used in convolution method;uses fftw3 libraries and opencv2 to open image
A side function file to be called to calculate the transfer function used in the convolution method. input from the 
main cpp parameters of height and width of the image,it then calculate the output result *in as the transfer function.
